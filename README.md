# GLCharge/oicp-client-go

Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains client libraries for OICP (Open Intercharge Protocol).

Every version has OpenAPI specification that is used to generate the client using `oapi-codegen` generator. For more
detailed documentation about the modules and APIs please follow the
official [OICP documentation](https://hubject.github.io/oicp-cpo-2.3-api-doc/)

## Generation

This code base was generated using [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen).

after creating or adjusting the OpenAPI specification. Please do not modify the clients, running
generation will overwrite them.
